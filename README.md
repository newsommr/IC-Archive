# IC-Archive
Repositiory for the archiving of reports from the Intelligence Community

This repository only includes reports that have been declassified and released to the public (via press release or FOIA).
People holding security clearances are safe to read them.

Feel free to create a pull request and add any reports you wish to contribute. Please make sure to include the source that you retrieved the resource from (must be from a .gov domain) so that I can verify it is authentic.
